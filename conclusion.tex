\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The transition from a monolithic architecture to a microservice architecture is not a simple task, especially when the size of the software system is immense. There exist extraction techniques that can aid the developers in analyzing their systems and proposing suggested decomposition approaches. However, none of these techniques can fully automate the decomposition process. In order to improve the accuracy of the splitting process, it is essential to provide a careful and reliable comparison of the current state-of-the-art software architecture extraction techniques. 

In this paper, we have presented a comparative analysis of two different types of extraction techniques called \bn and \fs. We assess the similarity of extraction results with the existing microservice version developed by experts on three open-source benchmarks using the MoJoFM metric. We conclude that the extraction results cannot achieve good performance on the small-scale benchmarks. Therefore, choosing a larger-scale benchmark will be our focus for the on-going work. By having a larger system, we are also able to perform other extraction tools that have minimum entities requirement for a more comprehensive comparative analysis.
